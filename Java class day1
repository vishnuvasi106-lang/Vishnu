JAVA:
----
What is java?
A Java is a programming language that is used to develop the new applications or a new softwares.
By using Java only we are creating the applications means that the wrong.
There are much more programming languages to develop the applications and softwares.
In that the java is one of them.
Without writing the class we can't write the java program.
Besically java is a object oriented programming language.

Programming Languages:
----------------------
There are 3 types of programming languages are there 
--->Structured Oriented Programming language.
--->Object Based Programming language.
--->Object Oriented Programming language.

-->Structured Oriented Programming Language:
   -----------------------------------------
     *In structured it follows the structure.
     *Based on the structur the programe will be build.
   Examples:
        c,etc...
-->Object Based Programming Language:
  ---------------------------------- 
     *In the object based , it follows the class and objects to create a programe.
     *By creating this two class and objects we can write the programs in this.
   Examples:
       TB,TBScript,etc...
-->Object Oriented Programming Language:
  ------------------------------------
    *In the object oriented programming language we can create the program using some key words that are Class,Object,Polymorphism,Inheritence,Abstraction,Encapsulation.
    *By using this all we may write the programs 
    Example:
      Java,Python,C++,c#,etc...

Features of Java:
-----------------
There are two featutes are there in java 
-->Platform Independent
-->Case Sensitive

-->Platform Independent:
   --------------------
    *The java is a programming language that can support the any type of the operating system.
    *The java programming language can be write in a multiple OS.
    *If we write a programe in one platform (OS),we can run that program without writing and modifying the code at all.
-->Case Sensitive:
   --------------
    *The case sensitive means that is about the letters that are in the upper case or in the lower case.
    *In java that considers the both upper case and lower case as supperatly.
